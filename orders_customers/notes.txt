HELP NEEDED
edit/update customer
- need to render the single customer view in the edit.html to edit.  I have having trouble with ngview displaying $scope.display_customers 
- I do not know how to render a single object in the html file using ngviews.  Currently I am pushing to the $scope.display_customers array.



Add order
- attach an id to a select in ng-repeat

Get orders
delete order
edit/update orders

mongoose validatators, a library


view customer
view customer orders
edit customer

Login/registration


DO LATER

  repopulate page after add and remove without going to the db
